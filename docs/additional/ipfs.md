# IPFS

IPFS is a decentralized distributed file system that revolutionizes traditional centralized storage models by distributing files across multiple nodes on the network, 
thereby enhancing reliability and availability. In IPFS, each file is uniquely identified by the hash value of its content, ensuring the file's uniqueness and immutability.

For the storage of NFT images, we can opt to use IPFS.

[NFT Storage](https://nft.storage/) is a storage solution based on IPFS, and we can use it to conveniently store NFT images.

## 1. Login

## 2. Upload
