# Deploy your contract to testnet

## 1. Build the contract

At the Terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
cd src
dotnet build
```

## 2. Deploy using AELF Explorer

:::tip

Note that when deploying a contract to the side chain, you need to transfer some ELF tokens to your side chain wallet first. You can use Portkey `send` for the transfer.

Additionally, on AElf, when a contract is deployed, AElf checks the contract code to ensure that two identical contracts are not deployed on AElf. Therefore, you can add a new line `var author = xxx` to distinguish each person's contract so that contracts can be deployed.

:::

AELF Explorer is a web service that allows easy deployment of smart contracts on the aelf blockchain.

Visit https://explorer-test-side02.aelf.io/proposal/proposals to start.

### 2.1. Login using Portkey extension

Login to the service using the Login button.

### 2.2. Deploy contract

Click on the `Apply` tab, followed by the `Deploy/Update Contract` tab.

Click on the `Click to Upload` button and choose the .dll file you built at `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/HelloWorld.dll.patched`.

Wait a few minutes while the deployment is in progress.

Copy the contract address once the deployment is completed.
